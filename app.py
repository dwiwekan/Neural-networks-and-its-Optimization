    - **Page 1: ANN Basics**: Learn about the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks and interactively visualize forward propagation with simple networks.
    - **Page 2: Gradient Descent**: Visualize gradient descent on a convex/non-convex function and understand how it converges with different learning rates.
    - **Page 3: Stochastic & Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Explore how stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch methods affect convergence with noisy data.
    - **Page 4: Gradient Descent Variants (Momentum, RMSProp, Adam)**: Compare different gradient descent variants and see how they perform on complex optimization landscapes.
    - **Page 5: Challenges in Optimization**: Explore issues like local minima, saddle points, and cliffs, and how to deal with them effectively.
