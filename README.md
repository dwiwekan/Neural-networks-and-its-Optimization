# Machine Learning Optimization Interactive Tutorials

Hi, this is the project of Machine Learning Optimization. On this Streamlit app, we will learn about ANN Basics, Gradient Descent, Optimizer Variants, and Optimization Challenges.

This interactive application helps you visualize and understand key machine learning optimization concepts through hands-on experimentation with:

- **ANN Basics**: Interactive neural network builder and classifier
- **Gradient Descent**: Visual exploration of optimization algorithms
- **Optimizer Variants**: Compare different optimization techniques
- **Optimization Challenge**: Apply your knowledge to solve real problems

## Features

- Interactive visualization of neural network architecture
- Real-time training visualization
- Customizable hyperparameters
- 2D and 3D visualizations of optimization landscapes
- Performance comparisons between different optimization techniques

## How to Install

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-optimization.git
   cd ml-optimization

2.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Try to Run the Streamlit on Your Machine!
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one)
- Launch the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

## Navigate through the different pages using the sidebar:
- ANN Basics
- Gradient Descent
